zenithBlindspot calculations for Alt and Az speeds using AstroPy library

This is just a small piece of test code written in Python for calculating the necessary speeds and accelerations of the Altidue and Azimuth axes on an Alt-Az telescope when an object passes close to the zenith.

Mainly it is a test of github for the NRT project by Liverpool John Moores University. See http://robotictelescope.org for more details.
